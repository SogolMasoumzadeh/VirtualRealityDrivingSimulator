# VirtualRealityDrivingSimulator

An immersive virtual reality driving simulator developed using C# and Unity game engine. 


Using unity game engine, this immersive driving simulator is programmed using object-oriented approaches and mainly C# programming language.
This driving simulator is a serious computer game, meaning that this game is designed with a purpose deeper than just mere entertainment! 
In a nutshell, this driving simulator is designed to help older adults and Alzheimer's patients for improving their spatial cognition or navigational skills. This driving simulator can be used either as a regular computer game, only using a PC with Windows OS, or it can be used in an immersive mode using VR headsets, in current version "Oculus Rift DK2". 

The effectiveness of this driving simualtor for improving older adults' navigational skills is evaluated through conducting a human-computer interaction (HCI) user study/ clinical trial.
